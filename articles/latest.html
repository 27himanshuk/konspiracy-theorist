    <h1>Latest in Konspiracy</h1>
    <p class="lead"> The Coronavirus pandemic has led to many konspiracies like the one about how this is all because of 5G? Or perhaps you heard how Bill Gates plans to slip surveillance technology into our bodies through a vaccine?
      And you can’t have escaped the theory that Covid-19 was created by a Chinese bioweapons lab, unless, of course you are behind the Great Chinese Firewall, in which case its due to an American bioweapons programme. Conspiracy theories flourish in lockdown.
      They are attempts to end uncertainty and the anxieties it causes by creating an explanation even when, or especially when, there seems to be no clear explanation. When faced with a virus whose origin, real impact and future prognosis are all unclear, rather than accept our bewildering helplessness, it is easier to clutch at an imagined cause. It helps us avoid having to confront our helplessness.</p>

    <p class="lead">
      The Coronavirus Pandemic has also led to the rise of Anti-vaccine believers, whose konspiracy theories range from linking them to the rise in autism to the greedy of pharmaceutical companies. The Christian story of the Nativity, when they see their babies for the first time, and resolve never to allow the vaccine to enter their veins.
      Such selfless faith is, of course, rather undermined by the fact that they are potentially exposing their children to the real suffering and risks of diseases that no longer need to happen — and other children as well, as the spread of anti-vaccination reduces community immunity.</p>

    <p class="lead"> The argument about the greed of pharmaceutical companies is also countered by the fact that their money is made from disease, rather than preventing it, so preventive vaccines are hardly the money spinner that curative medicines might be. And exhaustive studies have disproved the autism link.
     Covid-19 is now providing an interesting challenge for the anti-vaccination cultists. As the world intensifies its search for a vaccine, , what will the anti-vaccine votaries do? After all, this time it isn’t just their children whose lives they playing with, but their own.
     Some may succumb, but others are preparing for the challenge — like tennis champion Novak Djokovic, who at any point of time should stay away from konspiracies due to his stardom than to publically admit that he might refuse to take it, even if it means missing tournaments in countries which might insist on anyone coming in to be vaccinated.</p>
