        <h2 class="blog-post-title">The World We Live In</h2>

         <p>We live in a world where we are more connected to one another than ever and the advancement of technology is responsible for that. But at the same point of time these resouces that bring us together is also used to spread misinformation that we think is legitimate.</p>
         <p>The information that we consume through internet and various social media website could be described as legitimate news but is nothing more than misinformation.</p>
         <p>We also need to understand that blaming internet or social media is not going to solve anything as they are not the only source but at the same point of time they can with defining what comes under konspiracy theory, fake news and misinformation.</p>

        <h2>Defining Konspiracy</h2>
        <p>Konspiracy could be defined as secret plot by two or more powerful people.
         Konspiracies typically attempt to usurp political or economic power, violate rights, infringe upon
         established agreements, withhold vital secrets, or alter bedrock institutions.</p>

        <p>"Konspiracy theories” are also attempts to explain the ultimate causes of significant social and
          political events and circumstances with claims of secret plots by two or more powerful people.
          While often thought of as addressing governments, konspiracy theories could accuse any group perceived as
          powerful and malevolent. Conspiracy theories about the 9/11 terror attacks accuse the Bush administration,
          the Saudi Government, corporations, the financial industry, and the Jews; konspiracy
          theories about climate change accuse scientists, communists, the United Nations, Democrats, the government, and the oil industry among others.
          While a conspiracy refers to a true causal chain of events, a conspiracy theory refers to an allegation of conspiracy that may or may not be true.</p>

        <h3>Konspiracy Belief</h3>
        <p>"Konspiracy belief” — refers to belief in a specific conspiracy theory, or set of conspiracy theories.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>60% of Americans continue to believe that the CIA killed President John F. Kennedy</li>
          <li>2016 European Union membership referendum in the United Kingdom, about 46% of those intending to vote “leave” believed that the vote would be rigged.</li>
          <li>Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many of the social scientific studies on konspiracy theories focus on beliefs about:-</p>
        <ol>
          <li>the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</li>
          <li>the death of Diana, Princess of Wales;.</li>
          <li>9/11 “Truther” theories.</li>
          <li>theories about Barack Obama’s citizenship </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other studies have looked at beliefs that are less specific about the plot but accuse groups of conspiring more generally.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Konspiracy Thinking</h2>
        <p>This idea largely stems from the finding that people who already believe in particular conspiracy theories are
           likely to believe in others, even unrelated ones.</p>
        <p>This may indicate an underlying tendency for some people to prefer conspiracy explanations because
           of a bias against powerful disliked groups and official accounts.</p>
        <p>Other terms used to refer to this idea include “conspiracy predispositions,” “conspiracist ideation,” “conspiracy ideology,” “conspiracy mentality,” and “conspiracy
           worldview.”</p>
         </div><!-- /.blog-post -->

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title"> “Konspiracy Theorist”</h2>
         <p>“Konspiracy theorist” refers to a variety of concepts in both popular usage and
             in the literature. For some, the term refers to a person who believes in a particular conspiracy theory or has a strong tendency toward conspiracy thinking.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> It is sometimes used more specifically to denote a person who propagates conspiracy theories professionally (e.g., Alex Jones, David Icke).</li>
          <li>to people who advocate strongly for a conspiracy theory, such as former Florida Atlantic University
          Professor James Tracy who claims that the 2012 killings at the Sandy Hook elementary school in
          Connecticut in the United States were a hoax.</li>
          <li>Piers Corbyn—brother of UK Labour Party Leader
          Jeremy Corbyn—who claims that climate science is a fraud.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important for scholars to define what they mean by “conspiracy theorist” and “conspiracy
            theory” because—by signalling irrationality—these terms can neutralize valid concerns and delegitimize people.
            These terms can thus be weaponized, and because of this, people
            often deny that their ideas are conspiracy theories even though they clearly qualify. Politicians sometimes use these terms to deflect criticism because it turns the conversation back onto the accuser
            rather than the accused. The exact effect the term “conspiracy
            theory” and its variants have is open for debate. Some people are clearly repulsed by these terms,
            while others are attracted to them. Nonetheless, conspiracy theories are a controversial subject which can arouse passions
            both in and out of academia.</p>
